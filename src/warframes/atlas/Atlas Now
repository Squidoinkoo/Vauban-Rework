Titan of Stone Atlas

Abilities

  - Landslide: Bash enemies with an exploding sliding punch, and repeat for a devastating combo. Petrified enemies take extra damage, and drop Rubble when 
    destroyed. Rubble can heal Atlas and bolster his armor.
    
  - Tectonics: Summon a rock-wall, activate again to send the rocks crashing towards the enemy.
  
  - Atlas' hardened gaze will fossilize foes, heal Rumblers, and create Petrified Bulwarks. When shattered, petrified enemies drop healing Rubble for Atlas.
  
  - Summon two elemental stone brawlers to the melee. Summoning petrifies enemies in close proximity to Atlas. When finished, Rumblers collapse into a pile 
    of healing Rubble.

Passive

   if Atlas is at full health, Rubble instead grants additional Armor that decays over time.

 - Immovable: Strong as the mountain, Atlas is immune to knockdown effects while in contact with the ground.
