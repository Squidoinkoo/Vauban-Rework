Vauban

Abilities:

  - Tesla (Currently Balls o' Charging) -> Hologram
     - Deploys holo-projections of Tenno, creating aggro-pull. All enemy damage inflicted on the holo-projections will grant overshields. (I haven't decided 
       whether those shields should go to your squad as well)

  - Minelayer
    - Bounce -> Tesla
      - Pulses an electric wave
      - OR
      - Electrocutes the ground in a certain radius

    - Trip Laser
      - Functionally the same (it will still stun-lock enemies), but will deal around the same amount of damage as the lasers on Orokin Death Orbs (I know it's 
        a bit much damage-wise, but it's the best example I could think of)

    - Shred -> Swarm
      - When neared, the ball releases a swarm of nano-drones that deal True damage (there aren't shields or armor inside enemies, are there?)
 
    - Concuss -> ??? (I'm bad with names)
      - Magnetizes the ground, making it more difficult for enemies to lift their feet and, therefore, slowing them down

  - Bastille
    - It would be useful if bullets and projectiles (bombard rockets, nox...things, etc.) were suspended as well
       - Their momentum will be preserved as well, making it so when the duration runs out, they will continue on their course (which means watch out)
          - There will be a counter in the top right telling how many bullets are suspended, just so you know whether or not you need to watch out for
            1000 bullets flying at you at once
    - The base enemy cap was higher, if not removed completely

  - Vortex
    - Leave it be

Passive
 It kinda works with his kit, the only thing I can think of that would relate to his Corpus theme would be something like an innate Shield Disruption
