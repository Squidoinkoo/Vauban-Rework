/*
 Tesla (Currently Balls o' Charging) -> Hologram
 - Deploys holo-projections of Tenno, creating aggro-pull. All enemy damage inflicted on the holo-projections will grant overshields. (I haven't decided whether those shields should go to you solely or to your squad)

Minelayer
 - Bounce -> Tesla
    - Pulses an electric wave
    - OR
    - Electrocutes the ground in a certain radius
 - Trip Laser
    - Functionally the same (it will still stun-lock enemies), but will deal around the same amount of damage as the lasers on Orokin Death Orbs (I know it's a bit much damage-wise, but it's the best example I could think of)
 - Shred -> Swarm
    - When neared, the ball releases a swarm of nano-drones that deal True damage (there aren't shields or armor inside enemies, are there?)
 - Concuss -> ??? (I'm bad with names)
    - Magnetizes the ground, making it more difficult for enemies to lift their feet and, therefore, slowing them down

Bastille
 - Nothing really needs to be changed, I only wish that it's base enemy cap was higher, if not removed completely
 - It would be useful if projectiles like Bombard rockets and Nox...things were also suspended

Vortex
 - Leave it be
